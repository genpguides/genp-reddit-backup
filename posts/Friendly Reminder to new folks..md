# ‚ö†Ô∏è PLEASE READ AND PAY ATTENTION TO THE RESPECTIVE GUIDES INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS SUBREDDIT. IT'S ALL THERE!

[You can access all tips \/ guides \/ files through this top bar on New Reddit Style form.](https://preview.redd.it/m9teh0cfngjb1.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd10e278507fa712eb237507907f9304200eec52)

# Tips for new people:

1. **ALWAYS HAVE AN EXTERNAL BACK-UP OF ALL YOUR FILES** *- This is the most important rule.*
2. Read both [Patching Methods](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenP/wiki/index/#wiki_.1F4D6_.279C_patching_methods) and [WIKI](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenP/wiki/index/), so you know all the details between the methods.
3. The whole subreddit is in *New-Reddit-Style*, so all important links can only be found that way, however through the wiki you should be able to reach them (For folks using **old-reddit**).
4. Watch **OUR OWN** video tutorials *(if available)* on top section of each Guide as well reading the written guides for additional tips. - These will be 95% more up-to-date than your usual youtube search *"blablabla for free"*

# Having a brain, attention to detail and some cognitive thinking is required.

*Drink a cup of coffee or an energy drink and pay attention to all the information, folder locations and steps!*

**‚ö†Ô∏è GENERATIVE FILL (AI) is behind a paywall / credits, forget about it and stop asking about it, in other words IT NO LONGER WORKS. - Posts on the subject will be deleted.**
