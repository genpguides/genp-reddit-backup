# ‚ö†Ô∏è PLEASE READ AND PAY ATTENTION TO THE RESPECTIVE GUIDES INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS SUBREDDIT. IT'S ALL THERE!

# Tips for new people:

&gt;Read first the **Patching Methods in the WIKI**, so you know the differences between them.  
&gt;  
&gt;For folks in old-reddit: Guides are in New-Reddit-Style only, all important links can only be found that way, however through the wiki you should be able to reach them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Recommend watching **OUR OWN** video tutorials *(if available)* on top of each Guide methods and others, as well reading the written guides for additional tips. - These will be 95% more up-to-date than your usual youtube search *"blablabla for free"*

**Drink a cup of coffee or an energy drink and pay attention to all the information, folder locations and steps!**

# Having a brain, attention to detail and some cognitive thinking is required.
