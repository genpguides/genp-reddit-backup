# Tips for new people:

&gt;**ALWAYS HAVE AN EXTERNAL BACK-UP OF ALL YOUR FILES** *- This is the most important rule.*  
&gt;  
&gt;First read the [Patching Methods](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenP/wiki/index/#wiki_.1F4D6_.279C_patching_methods) **in the WIKI**, so you know the differences between the methods.  
&gt;  
&gt;For folks in old-reddit: Guides are in *New-Reddit-Style* only, all important links can only be found that way, however through the wiki you should be able to reach them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Recommend watching **OUR OWN** video tutorials *(if available)* on top of each Guide methods and others, as well reading the written guides for additional tips. - These will be 95% more up-to-date than your usual youtube search *"blablabla for free"*

**Drink a cup of coffee or an energy drink and pay attention to all the information, folder locations and steps!**

# Having a brain, attention to detail and some cognitive thinking is required.
