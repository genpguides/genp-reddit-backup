#**Current methods of Patching + Brief info**

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è **ATTENTION**

&gt; ***Please do not try to mix files and patching methods.***

&gt; ***That will work against you.***

&amp;nbsp;

#ü§° **Creative Cloud (CC) + GenP** *(Safest, but not Simplest to an extent)*

###‚ùî**What does it do?**

&gt; Uses the official Adobe installer to download the all of your selected programs *(using the trials option)*, once installed you then patch those with GenP, which replaces some of the file settings to make the program think that its activated during an undetermined amount of time, in other words "forever".

&gt;&gt; **It is only the latest versions only, there is no roll-back to older versions**

&gt; This includes trials, or coming from subscription model but want to cancel and patch to keep using it - only requirement is - programs must be installed in the computer.

&amp;nbsp;

###‚ùå **Issues**

&gt; Some cloud features / functions may refuse to work or malfunction due to needing contact to the servers, which the intention is to prevent said communication. However it should work well locally.

&gt; Due to evolution of ongoing updates both on CC and Apps, at any given point-in-time can break the patch or require unorthodox workarounds.

&gt; If you don't understand the minimum of what its talked in the guide or lack basic computer knowledge this might be a pain in the ass.

**App Issues with GENP**

* ‚ùå Lightroom is known to not always work
* ‚ùå Acrobat does not work. (use Acropolis instead)
* ‚ùå After Effects / Premiere HVEC - A1 have tendency to not work for some.

&amp;nbsp;

###üìë **How do you do it?**

&gt; It's a several steps Process, however sometimes there's a few issues with the patching not working as intended, but we can help if its not already mentioned in the guide or in old posts in reddit / discord.

&gt; üîó **[Guide #2 - CC+GenP][1]**

&amp;nbsp;

###‚ûú **For updates**

&gt; Yes, to a certain degree. To update the apps, simply open CC and see if there are updates to the programs, and choose update.

&gt; Once the update is done, close CC, open GenP and patch it again. **(new updates require repatching with GenP every time).**

&gt; However new updates can break the patch, usually its best if you don't update. Please **[Check the Update Compatibility List][3].**

#üêí **Monkrus Individual / Collection** *(Simplest, but not "Safest" to an extent)*

###‚ùî **What does it do?**

&gt; It's similar to the previous method, but with all the work already done for you. It's a modified installer made by a Russian Re-Packer code-named "Monkrus", **a well regarded and trusted so far by the community**.

&gt; Uses a re-pack of the official adobe programs, already pre-patched, and requires **no account signed in to work (offline use)**.

&gt; Its as simple as downloading and installing like any other type of software.

&gt; ‚ùó **Recommendation: best if you don't ever sign it with any account, so you stay offline at all times.**

&gt;&gt; Most of the unnecessary services that communicate to adobe servers are severed.

&gt; You could still sign-in if you wanted, but problems may arise and may brick the install, in other words, you may need to uninstall and reinstall without sign in.

&amp;nbsp;

###‚ùå **Issues**

&gt; Don't really know specifically how its patched.

&gt; There has been very few hacking related complaints towards the **Collection version** *(accounts like google, instagram or facebook)*, but it's never clear since usually people download from other random sources, got it from youtube, use bunch of other crap, and so on.

&gt; At the same time, **there are those who use / used individual version or even the collection, and have never had any of those related issues at all.**

&gt; The amount of data leaks have been increasing, so certain accounts could've already been leaked a while back but just nothing happened until then.

&gt; There's a mix of opinions, those who trust and those who don't, since there's never a clear conclusive proof or replication of the same problem it's a gray area.

&gt; ‚ùó **The links in the reddit and suggestions are to the source, and not other random file hosts.**

&gt; If going with Monkrus, please use the **Individuals** and not the collection.

&amp;nbsp;

###üìë **How do you do it?**

**2 Ways:**

&gt; 1. Individual apps (~2-5GB, dependent on the app) **Recommended**

&gt;&gt; *Can install as many as you want and you can use the pre-searched links available to help find them, otherwise but you must look for them specifically by yourself*

&gt; 2. Whole Adobe Collection (~22GB)

&gt;&gt; *One-Installer-Package with the whole programs, which you can choose after to install either one, two, or several programs at once.*

üîó **[Guide #7 - Monkrus][2]**

&gt; For truly stand alone apps without CC (no online/cloud services) and other BS background apps, this is probably the only choice.

&amp;nbsp;

###‚ûú **For updates**

&gt; Individual apps, whenever a new version is available in the site, download it, install on top of the old one.

&gt; M0nkrus Collection, you can only update when they release a new Collection Version. (And to update you just download the new collection, install on top of the old files)

&gt; Sometimes, it can happen that you remain with 2 versions installed at the same time, if such happens just uninstall the old version after installing the new one and keep the preferences if asked.
