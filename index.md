#‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ûú Welcome to the **WIKI**

&gt; From here, you will be able to find all the useful information for your journey!

Beforehand, a long overdue brief...

GenP was initially developed by uncia. Around the beginning of 2023, uncia announced their retirement from the scene in private forums but **released their last version, GenP 3.0.3 (known in Reddit as GenP 3.0)**, along with the source code. Due to this, a transition of responsibility to others capable of maintaining updates began to happen...

For obvious reasons, this has been kept from being shared thinking in the program's longevity since this could mean it would be patched much faster due to the nature of easy sharing in Reddit vs hard-to-get in private forums...

- *And no, the source code won't be shared because of what was stated above.*

At the same time, this caused various versions to appear, some working, some not, and others straight malware, none of which was truly from the original Creator *[as per an old announcement made](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenP/comments/1513xj7/important_announcement/)*.

Therefore, current versions and future versions are the efforts of individuals or groups who want to keep the program alive and safe for as long as possible. While there might be other versions around, we only support the one developed here (in case other collaborations happen for the greater good, we will be transparent about it).
