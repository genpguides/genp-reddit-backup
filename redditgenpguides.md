# ü§° **Guide #2 - Dummy Guide for First Timers GenP (CC + GenP)**

&gt; **~~[Video Tutorial: Updated Guide #2 - CC+GenP](https://odysee.com/@genp/guide2)~~ - Video outdated due to new versions of Genp, CCstopper and others**

**DOWNLOADS NEEDED**

&gt;üîó **[Creative Cloud (CC)][11]**

&gt;üîó **[GenP 3.0 - Modded][33]**

&gt;üîó **[CCStopper][9]**

&amp;nbsp;

‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention: [If you are having "Unlicensed popups | App will be disabled | Not loading or looping CC"](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenP/comments/ue47y6/possible_solution_to_unlicensed_app_popup_no/)**

&amp;nbsp;

**Instructions to CC + Genp** *picture guides only visible in desktop*

**1. Download Genp 3 - Modded, CCStopper, and extract ALL contents from zip**

&gt; Antivirus may sometimes delete or move files into quarantine.

&gt; You can either whitelist as safe or disable antivirus while extracting. This will fix the issue of **.exe** not showing in the folder after extracted.

![](%%Guide2-1-min%%)

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Download &amp; Install Creative Cloud**

&gt; Create a free account or use one you already have, preferably without any ongoing subscription *(avoid problems)*

&gt; During setup, *if possible* do **NOT install AGS** (Adobe Genuine Service)

&gt; **Disable Auto-Update** on it's settings *if possible*.

&gt; Once that is done go `Menu &gt; File &gt; Exit Creative Cloud`

![](%%Guide2-2-min%%)
![](%%Guide2-3-min%%)
![](%%Guide2-4-min%%)
![](%%Guide2-6-min%%)

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Replace Try with Install buttons using the Modded Utilities.**

&gt; Go to the **default** folder for adobe in your file Explorer:

&gt; `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\AppsPanel`

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Create a folder inside it named "BACKUP" and move the following files *(If you have them)* to it:

&gt; **AppsPanel.pimx, AppsPanelBL.dll and AppsPanellL.dll**

&gt; *(in case you want to restore them to default at a later date)*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Go to `Genp 3 - Modded &gt; Utilities &gt; restore install buttons [beta]`, there will be another 2 "AppsPanel" files. You will copy these into the default AppsPanel folder (NOT THE BACKUP ONE).

![](%%Guide2-7-min%%)

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Use CCStopper to block ADS via Firewall (blocking internet)**

**Run CCstopper as admin.** - You should be shown a menu with the following options which you must hit using the keyboard.

&gt; (2) for Internet Patch

&gt;&gt; (1) for Firewall Block.

Once that is done, you can select (Q) to quit CCStopper.

![](%%Guide2-9-min%%)
![](%%Guide2-10-min%%)

&amp;nbsp;

‚ùó **PAY ATTENTION** - Firewall Rules should be in effect, therefore they won't let Creative Cloud load or Update *(this is intentional)*.

‚ö†Ô∏è If antivirus is managing firewall settings, then you must create them in your antivirus firewall settings instead and not on windows *(whichever it is must be ON for the rules to take effect)* .

&amp;nbsp;

üí° **Turn `Windows Firewall OFF`, then open Creative Cloud and wait for it to load, once its loaded then turn `Windows Firewall ON`**

**Repeat this process everytime you need to download other apps but get server error**

&amp;nbsp;

**(If you do not care for the explanation of it, you may Skip to Step 5)**

&amp;nbsp;

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Informational purpose only of step 4**

&gt; *Explanation of what CCstopper does automatically with the use of the firewall rule*

&gt; Basically you are allowing internet access to Creative Cloud to load properly and blocking it again, by disabling and enabling the firewall rules.

&gt; Later you can disable, enable or delete them depending on your needs.

&gt; * OUTBOUND: Stops information from leaving PC to the Server, helps bypass Credit Card prompt.

&gt; * INBOUND: Stops information coming from Server to PC, helps bypass the trial countdown or app will be disabled prompt.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **How to add the same rules to firewall manually.**

&gt; Go to `Windows Firewall &gt; Advanced Settings`

&gt; Create **Outbound** rules on the following:

&gt; **Path of ADS** - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\ADS\Adobe Desktop Service.exe`

&gt; **Path of Licensing** - `C:\ProgramFiles\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\NGL\adobe_licensing_wf.exe`

&gt; **Path of Licensing helper** - `C:\ProgramFiles\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\NGL\adobe_licensing_wf_helper.exe`

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **How to create it:**

&gt; * **Rule type:** Program

&gt; * **Program:** (Paste the directory above and select the application.exe)

&gt; * **Action:** Block the connection

&gt; * **Profile:** All

&gt; * **Name:** (Choose a name that you will remember what it does)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; * The ADS rule is what causes Creative Cloud to take longer to load, not load at all or constantly loop, but its necessary to get in the app without triggering the CreditCard popup.

**Just remember that**

- Disabled: CreativeCloud works like normaly, but you cant download due to CreditCard popup.

- Enabled: The opposite happens, free to download but its stubborn a bit.

**END of Informational purpose only of step 4**

&amp;nbsp;

**5. Install Apps you want (Trial and Error)**

&gt; If the buttons didn't get replaced with install, click on Try nonetheless and see if it starts downloading.

&gt; Install all the apps you want in one go but don't open them yet. Wait until everything is installed, don't rush.

‚ú® **For Generative Fill PS** *(temporary)*

* Account must be set as higher than 18 years old

&gt; Only working for now in Beta version of Photoshop

In CC go on `Apps &gt; Categories &gt; Beta Apps &gt; Photoshop Beta`

Be aware: This is BETA and requires access to servers, so we're not going through the trouble of trying to figure out to make it work.

![](%%Guide2-11-min%%)

&amp;nbsp;

**6. Run GenP on the installed apps**

&gt; Open `GenP folder &gt; Resources &gt; Run GenP file`

&gt; If you're having issues opening it, turn AntiVirus OFF and try again, however **don't forget to turn it back ON before selecting Try or Download**.

&gt; Click **"Search Files"** and wait. *(will look at the default locations, use custom path if installed somewhere else)*

&gt; You can de-select paths in case you have any versions you dont want to patch. (in case of using Monkrus Acrobat)

&gt; Finally click the **PILL** to run the patch.

**Everything should be working now**

**OPEN THE APPS THROUGH THE .EXE and NOT FROM CC**

![](%%Guide2-14-min%%)

&amp;nbsp;

‚ûú **Optional - Block Each Installed app via Firewall**

*(Case of issues like app will be disabled, day counter, unable to launch app due to some popup)*

&gt; Go to `Windows Firewall &gt; Advanced Settings`

&gt; Create **Inbound and Outbound** rule on each app with issues

**Typical path example would be:** `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2022\Photoshop.exe`

&gt; Find the proper path for the one you need.

&amp;nbsp;

‚ûú **Optional - Block AGS via Firewall** - *(similar to step 4)*

&gt; Create both **Inbound** and **Outbound** rules on **Adobe Genuine Service**

Path of AGS - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\AdobeGenuineClient\AGSService.exe`

&amp;nbsp;

‚ö†Ô∏è **ATTENTION**

&gt; Always check first the monthly **[Compatibility List][5]** before updating any apps, otherwise don't update.

&gt; If you want to install / update more apps, hit "**Install/Update**" on New app, let it download, and **run GenP** on them again.

# ‚ò¢Ô∏è **Guide #4 - NOTHING IS WORKING / FULL CLEANING**

**[Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/jezUElhqrRA)** *(0 to 7:20 only)*

**DOWNLOADS NEEDED**

&gt;üîó **[Creative Cloud CLEANER TOOL][10]**

Another option (but not covered below)

&gt;üîó **[RevoUninstaller][13]**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention** - please read

&gt; If you been having, continue to have issues overall or simply want to restore to normal. We would advise to remove everything adobe related, and start all fresh.

&gt; Any brushes, patterns, plugins or other assets should be saved/exported to folders outside adobe main folders.

&gt;&gt; Referring to master files where all edits are done such as `.psd`, `.ai`, `.ae`, etc...

&gt; Export and save them into a dedicated folder if you dont have it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Instructions to Fully Clean:**

**1. Remove any trace of ALL Adobe**

&gt; Run Adobe Cleaner Tool in **ALL** | *(E, Y, 1, Clean All, Y)*

&gt; Check Windows Control Panel &gt; Uninstall, and see if the app was removed successfully, otherwise remove it there manually.

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Delete Adobe folders from your disk drive**

&gt; `C:\Program files`

&gt; `C:\Program files\common files`

&gt; `C:\Program files x86`

&gt; `C:\Program files x86\common files`

&gt; `%appdata%\local`

&gt; `%appdata%\local\temp`

&gt; `%appdata%\roamming`

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Registry Editor**

&gt; Windows key, write "registry editor" should show up

&gt; On *HKEY_CURRENT_USER* and *HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE*

&gt; Look for **Software** and delete **Adobe**.

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Remove Windows Firewall rules or Host File lines**

&gt; **For Windows Firewall**

&gt; Go to `Windows &gt; Windows Firewall &gt; Advanced Settings`

&gt; Check both in **Inbound** and **Outbound**

&gt; Remove or disable any rules blocking adobe processes or services, could be named with CCStopper or any other name you gave them.

&gt; If you created these in your AntiVirus, you'll have to do the same there.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **For Host File**

&gt; Go to `%WinDir%\System32\Drivers\Etc`

&gt; Right-click on "**hosts**" file, "Open with notepad" and remove all the lines related to "# BLOCK ADOBE #" in this post, save the file and reboot your system:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **DEFAULT HOST LINES - You can copy-and-paste it**

&gt; \# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.

&gt; \#

&gt; \# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.

&gt; \#

&gt; \# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each

&gt; \# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should

&gt; \# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.

&gt; \# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one

&gt; \# space.

&gt; \#

&gt; \# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual

&gt; \# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.

&gt; \#

&gt; \# For example:

&gt; \#

&gt; \#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server

&gt; \#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

&gt; 

&gt; \# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.

&gt; \#	127.0.0.1       localhost

&gt; \#	::1             localhost

&amp;nbsp;

**5. Restart the PC**

&gt; Adobe should not be in your system, and if you install it again it will behave normally üôÇ

# ‚ñ∫ **Guide #6 - Remove "Trial Expires in XX Days" / "Trial Ended" / "Trial Popup" Banner**

*- Thanks songmj36, Lian, Louis*

**THIS IS ONLY AESTHETIC! IF THE PATCH WORKS, AFTER TRIAL ENDS THE APP CONTINUES TO WORK. Don't lose your head because its counting down or says it ended.**

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT RUN GENP ON MONKRUS**

&gt; If **switching completely** from CC+GenP to Monkrus, please run **GUIDE 4** to **clean everything**, as you want a clean slate to avoid problems with leftover files from the other method.

&amp;nbsp;

**Instructions to Install Monkrus Individual / Collection:**

**1. Download and Install the [Torrent Software - qbittorrent][17]**

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Choose which one you want: Monkrus Collection OR Individual App of choice from the Download links**

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è AntiVirus may have blacklisted the site causing it to not "load / could not reach url", if you disabled AV should load normally.

&gt; To translate the page to your language - on the top-right says "Translate with flags icons",

&gt; Go down until you find "DOWNLOAD FROM THE TORRENT TRACKER OF YOUR CHOICE"

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **On Rutracker:**

&gt; Requires registration for the magnet link to appear.

&gt; Small **Magnet Icon** *(should be right in the middle of the page)* or download the .torrent file and then open it with Torrent Software to extract it.

![](%%Rutracker-location%%)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **On PB.WTF:**

&gt; Does not require registration

&gt; "Magnet —Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞" on the right (next to green and blue buttons)

![](%%PBWTF-location%%)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Let it download. *(once it says "Seeding", it's been downloaded)*

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Go to the downloaded folder, find the "disk or .iso file", double-click to open and run "autoplay.exe" as ADMINISTRATOR.**

&gt; For collection: Choose whatever apps you want to install (you don't need all).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention - The apps themselves are to work without an account signed in**

&amp;nbsp;

**If the install window doesn't show up or Errors (failed to...)**

&gt; Turn anti-virus OFF for the installation process - that may be preventing the window from showing up (may be windows defender or other AV you have). You may turn it back on after the install.

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Once everything is installed and working properly you can EJECT the DVDdrive found at "MyComputer / This PC"**

&gt; The DVDdrive is created when you open the ".iso" file, which is in fact a virtual installation CD - It has no other purpose besides that.

&gt; You may also delete or not the files extracted from the torrent (installer). Up to you if you want to keep them.

# ‚ñ∫ **Guide #8 - Blocking unnecessary Adobe Background processes(PS/DC)**

*- Thanks u/Verix-*

**For Photoshop**

All you have to do is rename these 5 exe-files.

&gt; 1. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Sync\CoreSync\CoreSync.exe`

&gt; 2. `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Creative Cloud Experience\CCXProcess.exe`

&gt; 3. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\ADS\Adobe Desktop Service.exe`

&gt; 4. `C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Creative Cloud Libraries\CCLibrary.exe`

&gt; 5. `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2021\LogTransport2.exe`


--&gt; Just add another letter after the ".exe". 

For example: "CoreSync.exe"--&gt;"CoreSync.exeW"

(If you dont see ".exe" in the file name, you need to make the file name extensions visible in your explorer)

---

**For Acrobat DC**

All you have to do is rename these exe-file.

&gt; 1. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat DC\Acrobat\AdobeCollabSync.exe`

--&gt; Just add another letter after the ".exe". 


For example: "AdobeCollabSync.exe"--&gt;"AdobeCollabSync.exeV"

(If you dont see ".exe" in the file name, you need to make the file name extensions visible in your explorer)

**FOR UPDATES ON ALL:**

&gt; In order to update Creative Cloud, its recommended reverting at least the name change of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\ADS\Adobe Desktop Service.exe`.

&gt; To update the other apps, you should undo all changes to be on the safe side.
