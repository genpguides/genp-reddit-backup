# ‚ò†Ô∏è **Guide #2 - Dummy Guide for First Timers GenP (CC + GenP)**

&gt; **[No Video Tutorial for Revamp 2024 yet]**

**DOWNLOADS / TOOLS NEEDED**

&gt;üîó **[Creative Cloud (CC)][11]**

&gt;üîó **[GenP 3.4.13 Beta 4][38]** - Current Updated Version

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ‚õî **Generative Fill or AI online features DO NOT WORK**

&gt; Without a valid subscription or valid active trial (7 days) you can forget about it. It's been adapted into the monthly credits  service for valid subscription users (pay-wall). Therefore, its gone.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è **Any ongoing new changes or fixes might not be immediately reflected in both the tools or the written guides (we're people and have lives too), but we will try to keep it updated ASAP.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Instructions to CC + Genp** *pictures in the guides are only visible on full desktop mode, not on mobile*

&amp;nbsp;

**1. Download &amp; Install Creative Cloud**

&gt; You can Create a free account using your own email, using a temporary email *(search on google "temp mail" and any should work)*, or use an account you already have, preferably without any ongoing subscription *(to avoid problems)*

&gt; During setup, *if shown* do **NOT install AGS** (Adobe Genuine Service), *if not shown, continue anyway*

![](%%1-CC-Download-min%%)
![](%%3-CC-Sign-in-min%%)
![](%%4-CC-Sign-in-min%%)

&amp;nbsp;

Once installed go to `Menu &gt; File &gt; Preferences` and in the "General" tab **disable the following:**

&gt; Launch at login

&gt; Sync files in the background after quitting

&gt; Automatically keep it updated

**Once that is done go `Menu &gt; File &gt; Exit Creative Cloud`**

![](%%5-CC-Menu-min%%)

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Download the latest Genp in the guide - Extract ALL contents from zip**

&gt; Once you have the `.zip` file, Right-click and "Extract All" contents.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è*Possible Problem &amp; Solution - Step 2*

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è Antivirus may sometimes delete or move files into quarantine. You can either whitelist as safe or disable antivirus while extracting. This will fix the issue of **.exe** not showing in the folder after extracted.

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Patch CreativeCloud with "Patch CC" button**

&gt; With current updated version of GenP opened, press the button that says "Patch CC"

&gt; The patch run automatically and perform all the necessary actions (do not touch anything until done)

&gt; You will know its finished when it switches to the log menu (this is only informational, continue with the guide)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è*Possible Problem &amp; Solution - Step 3*

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è If you get "M2-Team NSUDO Launcher - Error: Failed to create a process", mouse gets stuck on loading or GenP doesn't open:

&gt; `CTRL+SHIFT+ESC`, in the "Processes" tab look for the GenP Process, Right-Click on it - "EndTask"

&gt; Then delete the NSUDO file from the extracted files, try opening GenP again - If working now, redo the proper step.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Every time CC gets updated, you must apply the "Patch CC" again.*

![](%%8-GenP-Menu-min2%%)
![](%%PatchingCCButton-min%%)

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Open Creative Cloud &gt; Apps &gt; Install**

**On the side menu, if you click on "Apps"**

&gt; You should now have the install button, install all the apps you want, wait until everything is installed and DON'T OPEN ANY YET.

**Once once everything you want is installed go `Menu &gt; File &gt; Exit Creative Cloud`**

![](%%6-CC-Menu-Install-min%%)

&amp;nbsp;

**5. Run GenP on the installed apps**

&gt; Open `GenP folder &gt; Run "AdobeGenP.exe"`

&gt; Click on the button **"Search"** and wait. *(it will look at the default locations in `C:`)* - *(The "Path" is if apps were installed somewhere else, most likely you'll never need to use this option tho)*

&gt; In case you have any programs you don't want to patch, you can de-select the respective paths.

&gt; Finally click on the button **"PATCH"** to run the patch on the apps and wait until its done.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è*Possible Problem &amp; Solution - Step 5*

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're having issues opening it, turn AntiVirus OFF and try again, however **don't forget to turn it back ON after its patched**.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Every time the apps get updated, you must apply the "Patch" on the respective apps again.*

![](%%8-GenP-Menu-min2%%)
![](%%PatchingAppsButtons-min%%)

&amp;nbsp;

**6. OPEN THE APPS THROUGH THEIR `.EXE` and NOT FROM Creative Cloud directly;**

&gt; Be aware you are free to pin the apps and open them from taskbar, start, .exe, shortcut, etc... The important part is: Don't open CC just to click OPEN on, for example, Photoshop...  

**Everything should be working now! End of Guide.**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è **Installing/Updating - Possible Problem &amp; Solution**

&gt; Always check the monthly **[Compatibility List][5]** before updating any apps, otherwise don't update.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **APPS: If you want to install more apps / update them**, hit "Install/Update" on said app, let it download, and then **run GenP** on them again, using the "Search" Button, and then the "Patch" Button.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **CC: If you update CC**, hit "Update", let it update, and then **run GenP** on it again, using the "Patch CC" Button.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; If any other issues occur, Run GenP on compatibility mode to Windows 10/11.

&gt; If something ain't working properly or you get the Unlicensed Popup, check the **[TROUBLESHOOT SECTION | UNLICENSED POPUP]** towards the bottom of the guides page.

# ‚ò¢Ô∏è **Guide #4 - NOTHING IS WORKING / FULL CLEANING**

**[Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/jezUElhqrRA)** *(0 to 7:20 only)*

**DOWNLOADS / TOOLS NEEDED**

&gt;üîó **[Creative Cloud CLEANER TOOL][13]**

Another option (but not covered below)

&gt;üîó **[Revo Uninstaller (Optional)][14]**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention** - please read

&gt; If you been having, continue to have issues overall or simply want to restore to normal. We would advise to remove everything adobe related, and start all fresh.

&gt; Any brushes, patterns, plugins or other assets should be saved/exported to folders outside adobe main folders.

&gt;&gt; Referring to master files where all edits are done such as `.psd`, `.ai`, `.ae`, etc...

&gt; Export and save them into a dedicated folder if you dont have it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Instructions to Fully Clean:**

**1. Remove any trace of ALL Adobe**

&gt; Run Adobe Cleaner Tool in **ALL** | *(E, Y, 1, Clean All, Y)*

&gt; Check Windows Control Panel &gt; Uninstall, and see if the app was removed successfully, otherwise remove it there manually.

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Delete Adobe folders from your disk drive**

&gt; `C:\Program files`

&gt; `C:\Program files\common files`

&gt; `C:\Program files x86`

&gt; `C:\Program files x86\common files`

&gt; `%appdata%\local`

&gt; `%appdata%\local\temp`

&gt; `%appdata%\roamming`

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Registry Editor**

&gt; Windows key, write "registry editor" should show up

&gt; On *HKEY_CURRENT_USER* and *HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE*

&gt; Look for **Software** and delete **Adobe**.

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Remove Windows Firewall rules or Host File lines**

&gt; **For Windows Firewall**

&gt; Go to `Windows &gt; Windows Firewall &gt; Advanced Settings`

&gt; Check both in **Inbound** and **Outbound**

&gt; Remove or disable any rules blocking adobe processes or services, could be named with CCStopper or any other name you gave them.

&gt; If you created these in your AntiVirus, you'll have to do the same there.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **For Host File**

&gt; Go to `%WinDir%\System32\Drivers\Etc`

&gt; Right-click on "**hosts**" file, "Open with notepad" and remove all the lines related to "# BLOCK ADOBE #" in this post, save the file and reboot your system:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **DEFAULT HOST LINES - You can copy-and-paste it**

&gt; \# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.

&gt; \#

&gt; \# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.

&gt; \#

&gt; \# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each

&gt; \# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should

&gt; \# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.

&gt; \# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one

&gt; \# space.

&gt; \#

&gt; \# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual

&gt; \# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.

&gt; \#

&gt; \# For example:

&gt; \#

&gt; \#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server

&gt; \#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

&gt; 

&gt; \# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.

&gt; \#	127.0.0.1       localhost

&gt; \#	::1             localhost

&amp;nbsp;

**5. Restart the PC**

&gt; Adobe should not be in your system, and if you install it again it will behave normally üôÇ

&gt;&gt; *Check description in tracker for compatibility with Premiere / After Effects versions - "extracted from ... version"*

&amp;nbsp;

**Few details to pay attention to**

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monkrus Collection is dropped due to malware concerns** - This has been mentioned for months but now its final. If you use it, its your problem.

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT RUN GENP ON MONKRUS** - If **switching completely** from CC+GenP to Monkrus, please run **GUIDE 4** to **clean everything**, as you want a clean slate to avoid problems with leftover files from the other method.

&gt; ‚õî **Generative Fill or AI online features DO NOT WORK ANYMORE - stop asking about it**

&gt; Without a valid subscription or active trial (7 days) you can forget about it. It's been adapted into the monthly credits  service for valid subscription users (pay-wall). Therefore, its gone.

&amp;nbsp;

**Instructions to Install Monkrus Individual:**

**1. Download and Install the [Torrent Software - qbittorrent][16]**

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Choose app of choice from Monkrus Individual on Download links above**

&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è AntiVirus may have blacklisted the site causing it to not "load / could not reach url", if you disabled AV should load normally.

&gt; To translate the page to your language - on the top-right says "Translate with flags icons",

![](%%MonkTranslate%%)

&gt; Go down until you find "DOWNLOAD FROM THE TORRENT TRACKER OF YOUR CHOICE"

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **On Rutracker:**

&gt; Requires an account registration for the magnet link to appear (temporary mail can be used).

&gt; Small **Magnet Icon** *(should be right in the middle of the page)* or download the .torrent file and then open it with Torrent Software to extract it.

![](%%Rutracker-location%%)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **On PB.WTF:**

&gt; Should not require registration

&gt; "Magnet —Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞" on the right (next to green and blue buttons)

![](%%PBWTF-location%%)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Once you click in said magnet, you should get these prompts or similar, which you'll want to allow and choose "Qbit" to open the link.

![](%%MonkPrompt-Magnet%%)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Now you should choose where you want the files to be downloaded to, make sure everything of the files is selected and click "OK" to start

![](%%qBit-Prompt%%)

&gt; Let it download. *(when it reaches 100% it changes from "Downloading" into "Seeding", the files have been downloaded, you can simply right click it and choose remove)*

![](%%qBit-Prompt-Complete%%)

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Go to the downloaded folder, find the "disk or .iso file", double-click to open and run "autoplay.exe" as ADMINISTRATOR.**

&gt; For individual: Proceed with the install setup.

&gt; ~~For collection: Select the apps you want to install (you don't need all).~~

‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention - Majority apps should work without any account signed in (cloud-based might need)**

&amp;nbsp;

**If the install window doesn't show up or Errors (failed to...)**

&gt; Turn anti-virus OFF for the installation process - that may be preventing the window from showing up (may be windows defender or other AV you have). You may turn it back on after the install.

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Once everything is installed and working properly you can EJECT the DVDdrive found at "MyComputer / This PC"**

&gt; The DVDdrive is created when you open the ".iso" file, which is in fact a virtual installation CD - It has no other purpose besides that.

&gt; You may also delete or not the files extracted from the torrent (installer). Up to you if you want to keep them.

&amp;nbsp;

**ü™ô To update Monkrus just install the newer version on top of the old one**

&gt; If something ain't working properly or you get the Unlicensed Popup, check the **[TROUBLESHOOT SECTION | UNLICENSED POPUP]** towards the bottom of the guides page.

# ‚ñ∫ **Guide #8 - Blocking unnecessary Adobe Background processes(PS/DC)**

*- Thanks u/Verix-*

**For Photoshop**

All you have to do is rename these 4 exe-files.

&gt; 1. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Sync\CoreSync\CoreSync.exe`

&gt; 2. `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Creative Cloud Experience\CCXProcess.exe`

&gt; 3. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\ADS\Adobe Desktop Service.exe`

&gt; 4. `C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Creative Cloud Libraries\CCLibrary.exe`


--&gt; Just add ".bak" after the ".exe". 

For example: "CoreSync.exe"--&gt;"CoreSync.exe.bak"

(If you dont see ".exe" in the file name, you need to make the file name extensions visible in your explorer)

---

**For Acrobat DC**

All you have to do is rename these exe-file.

&gt; 1. `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat DC\Acrobat\AdobeCollabSync.exe`

--&gt; Just add ".bak" after the ".exe". 


For example: "AdobeCollabSync.exe"--&gt;"AdobeCollabSync.exe.bak"

(If you dont see ".exe" in the file name, you need to make the file name extensions visible in your explorer)

**FOR UPDATES ON ALL:**

&gt; In order to update Creative Cloud, its recommended reverting at least the name change of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\ADS\Adobe Desktop Service.exe`.

&gt; To update the other apps, you should undo all changes to be on the safe side.

**1. Use the following command in PowerShell (as admin) if your apps are warning you of unlicensed or non-genuine usage:**

&gt; `Stop-Process -Name "Adobe Desktop Service" -force`

![](%%Powershell%%)

&amp;nbsp;

‚ö†Ô∏è The Host Lines in the Genp "Pop-up" button option may not always be up-to-date (due to when a new line is found), therefore always check to see if the lines added matches the ones written below. If some lines are missing either wait for the update or add it manually afterwards.

**2. Open Notepad (as admin)**, go to FILE &gt; OPEN &gt; `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` &lt;- Copy paste this directory to the file explorer bar, press enter and select the file "hosts"

‚ö†Ô∏è (If you do not see it, make sure you're looking for `"All file types (*.*)` and NOT `Text files (*.txt)`)

![](%%Host-location%%)

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Copy the whole block of text from (https://a.dove.isdumb.one/list.txt) and paste into a blank line on your host file. After that is done, save it.**

Done.

# (...) 2Ô∏è‚É£ **FIREWALL RULE on App-in-question.exe**

If the Host lines (updated and correctly applied) aren't being enough to stop it, you can experiment with the following:

&gt; Go to `Windows Firewall &gt; Advanced Settings`

‚ö†Ô∏è If you see this warning, All firewall rules must be done in your antivirus firewall settings, and not on windows defender firewall (otherwise they will have no effect) - But just in case, have in both lol

![](%%Firewall%%)

Outbound Rules should be more than enough. Only do both if the first doesn't work.

![](%%Firewall-Outbound%%)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Create **Outbound** rule on each app with issues

**Structure is the following:**

&gt; **File Type:** Program

&gt; **Program:** It's necessary to select the actual "program".exe inside the folder that was installed because the shortcut will not work.

When looking for the program path, we want the Actual Program \".exe\" and not the shortcuts. How to distinct them - LEFT: SHORTCUT \".EXE\" | RIGHT: ACTUAL \".EXE\"

![](%%Shortcun-vs-Real-EXE%%)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;&gt; **Typical path example would be:** `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2023\Photoshop.exe` (Find the proper path for the app you need)

&gt; **Action:** Block Connection

&gt; **Profile:** All

&gt;&gt; **Name:** Name it whatever you want to know what's blocking.

‚ö†Ô∏è **If the issue persist, you can create the same rules for "Inbound"**

&amp;nbsp;

You will lose internet access going out from the application, at the same time, the license also wont be able to check if good or bad.

Outside of that, unplug internet problem solved lol

# (...) 3Ô∏è‚É£ **RESTORE (reverse of options 1 and 2)**

Most probably because of Host file edits or Firewall rules (including outdated ones) that are either working against each other or blocking something that shouldnt be blocked.

**Reverse Hosts File edit:**

**1. Open Notepad (as admin)**, go to FILE &gt; OPEN &gt; `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` &lt;- Copy paste this directory to the file explorer bar, press enter and select the file "hosts"

‚ö†Ô∏è (If you do not see it, make sure you're looking for `"All file types (*.*)` and NOT `Text files (*.txt)`)

&amp;nbsp;
 
**2. Remove all lines related to adobe stuff, save the file and reboot your system**

&gt; This should fix the looping and bring CC to its default behavior, but at the same time will be open to internet - which may cause issues for the apps currently installed.

&gt; If it happens, do **Option 2 and create an Outbound rule** for the programs `.exe` malfunctioning.

&amp;nbsp;

**Reverse Firewall Rule:**

&gt; `Windows &gt; Windows Firewall &gt; Advanced Settings`  
 
&gt; Check both **Inbound and Outbound**  
 
&gt; **Disable** or remove any rules that are applied to AD0BE or other firewall rules you created or asked in the guides.

&amp;nbsp;

**If neither of these have fixed the issue,**

&gt; Please uninstall everything to the max using [‚ò¢Ô∏è Guide #4 - NOTHING IS WORKING / FULL CLEANING](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenP/wiki/redditgenpguides/#wiki_.2622.FE0F_guide_.234_-_nothing_is_working_.2F_full_cleaning) and restart the respective guide you were doing from the beginning. This should ensure a clean slate.

**If still not working let us know - but please be specific on:**

&gt; What method you have (genp or monkrus);  

&gt; Which of these fixes didnt work;  

&gt; What problem still happens;

&amp;nbsp;

‚ûú **Optional - Block AGS via Firewall**

&gt; Create **Outbound** rules on **Adobe Genuine Service**

Path of AGS - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\AdobeGenuineClient\AGSService.exe`

‚ö†Ô∏è **If the issue persist, you can create the same rules for "Inbound"**

&amp;nbsp;

‚ûú **Optional - Uninstall AGS - Adobe Genuine Service**

Open PowerShell, as admin, and enter:

```[System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start("C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\AdobeGCClient\AdobeCleanUpUtility.exe")```

and follow the on-screen instructions.

If that directory is absent then the service won‚Äôt be installed. 

&amp;nbsp;

‚ûú **Restore AppsPannel (vanilla)**

Only if you want to restore from the previously made backup and move into official paid functionality, use the following command:

&gt; ```cp "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\AppsPanel\AppsPanelBL.dll.bak" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\AppsPanel\AppsPanelBL.dll"```

If no errors are printed to the console, restart your machine. Upon startup, Creative Cloud will be returned to normal functionality‚Äî
